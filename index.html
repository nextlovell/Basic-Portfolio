        <p>I'm a seasoned product leader, entrepreneur, and strategist. I wake up every day thinking of how to make our product better (and about coffee). I'm expert in finding product-market fit, developing go-to-market strategy, launching fresh products, and listening to what customers are really saying so we can get better.</p>
        <p>Proud to be part of the Salesforce Ohana. I oversee the #1 and #13 most-used components on our incredible platform, serving ~10 million user queries a week and growing fast.</p>
        <p>I've worn many hats in my career: CEO, product owner, team leader, strategist, UX designer, researcher, programmer. As a result, I'm uniquely well-suited to navigating complex challenges and leading multi-disciplinary projects. But real-world experience has taught me my professional value comes from:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>When customers speak, I listen</li>
          <li>I speak fluent engineer, designer, marketer, salesperson, and difficult client. Understanding means fewer missteps and missteps cost a fortune</li>
          <li>I put in the time to be prepared</li>
          <li>I have BIG IDEAS but I know execution is what matters. I execute</li>
          <li>I don't care who gets credit. All I want is to win</li>
          <li>When things are on fire, I'm the calm one</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I love meeting new people with exciting ideas. Reach out if you want to talk tech, hiking, or soccer. @Alexander_SF on Twitter</p>
